title: 60% Keyboard (Ducky One 2 Mini) configuration - Part 1

I recently got a [Ducky One 2 Mini]. It's pretty good, and the 60% layout is
almost perfect for me [^65lament]. But I have a couple of concerns/use cases for
which I need to configure the keyboard slightly:

- As there is no Function Row, the Escape key is where the `` ` ``/`~`  would
  usually be. My [existing configuration] already binds my Caps Lock to function
  as both my Escape and Control, while keeping the LCtrl as is and changing
  Escape to Caps Lock. Long story short, I need the `` ` `` more than I need the
  Escape key (Caps Lock). 
- The default position of the Function key isn't great, so I would like it right
  next to the Spacebar. This happens to line up with what's needed for the next
  point.
- There are some times where I do need dedicated arrow keys, such as when
  playing Hollow Knight. 

This will be done entirely with Ducky's internal configuration -- at the
keyboard software level -- using keyboard profiles and macros. To get a hang of
that, check your manual. The instructions will assume 0 knowledge of these
functions, but it's best if you do figure it out.

# `` ` `` in place of Escape

(Reminder: my Escape key is actually a Caps Lock, so I don't mind losing it. The
process will make Caps Lock inaccessible.)

This is achieved by setting up a macro to register `` ` `` when the Escape key
is pressed. 

- First, switch over to a free profile using `Fn` + `Alt` + `number`. The
  corresponding number on the keyboard and Caps Lock will flash for about a 
  second. I used Profile 2; anything that is **not** Profile 1 will work. 
- Now, to actually record the macro:
    - **Enter the macro recording mode** by holding down on `Fn` + `Alt` + `Tab`
      for 3 seconds. The entire keyboard will flash for a second, and then only 
      the Function and Caps Lock keys will be lit up, blinking slowly. 
    - **Remapping Escape to `` ` ``**: press the key to be mapped to an output
      -- `Esc`, in this case. This key will now light up, blinking fast. Then,
      enter the input sequence this key will map to [^macroseq], which is here
      the `` ` `` key, or `Fn` + `Esc`. To end recording the macro, press `Fn` +
      `Alt`, and the blinking will become slow again. You can record other
      macros in the same way.
    - **End the macro recording mode** by holding down again on `Fn` + `Alt` +
      `Tab` for a second. [^deleting]

# Function next to Spacebar

For this, I used the DIP switches on the back of the keyboard. 
[Check this reddit post] if you want to understand how they work. 

We'll be using a single feature -- switch 1. Switch it to the "ON" position.
This changes the layout as follows:

Swap out the keycaps accordingly.

# Dedicated Arrow keys

This is achieved with macros, enabling the DIP switch 1, and sacrificing the 
right control array -- (Right) `Alt`, `Super`,
`Control`, and `Shift` are replaced by `Left`, `Down`, `Right`, and `Up` 
respectively. You
might wish to change these keys if any of them are part of your daily keyboard
shortcuts. If, for example, you want to switch `l`, `;`, `'`, and `p` instead,
enabling DIP 1 isn't necessary either.

We follow the macro recording procedure again. I suggest you use the Left Alt
key and not the Right Alt for the recording process.

- First, switch over to a free profile using `Fn` + `Alt` + `number`. The
  corresponding number on the keyboard and Caps Lock will flash for about a 
  second. I used Profile 6; anything that is **not** Profile 1 will work. 
- Now, to record the macros:
    - **Enter the macro recording mode** by holding down on `Fn` + `Alt` + `Tab`
      for 3 seconds. The entire keyboard will flash for a second, and then only 
      the Function and Caps Lock keys will be lit up, blinking slowly. 
    - **Remapping the keys to their arrow equivalents**: press the key to be 
      mapped to an output. Take (Right) `Alt` as an example, to be mapped to
      `Left` (aka `Fn` + `j`). This key will now light up, blinking fast. Then,
      enter the input sequence this key will map to [^macroseq], which is here
      the `Left` key, or `Fn` + `j`. To end recording the macro, press `Fn` +
      `Alt`, and the blinking will become slow again. Repeat this for the other
      three directional keys. For a quick reference, 

      | Directional Key | Shortcut     |
      |-----------------|--------------|
      | Left            | Function + j |
      | Down            | Function + k |
      | Right           | Function + l |
      | Up              | Function + i |

    - **End the macro recording mode** by holding down again on `Fn` + `Alt` +
      `Tab` for a second. [^deleting]

This will only be active in your profile configured, so you can switch to it
only for very specific case, as I do.

# Footnotes

[^deleting]: In order to reset the macros in a particular profile, one can press `Fn` + `Backspace`. The Escape key will light up once to confirm this.

[^macroseq]: Macros can be mapped to full sentences. All actions done will be recorded, such as an errant typo or a backspace, recorded at the speed that the macro was typed out in the first place.

[^65lament]: Ideally I'd like a 65% keyboard because I do really like arrow keys. But the only option I had for a keyboard that wasn't full-sized and still had arrow keys were a few TKL options. Now I wouldn't straight up *mind* it, but the keycap options weren't as pretty, and I'm not going to go buy ~ 2k worth of keycaps after buying a keyboard worth 8-9k (INR). Kind of a weird reason, but I don't use arrow keys *that* much. Except for in certain circumstances. Which is why this is a blog, because I need to document the circumstances and how to set the keyboard up accordingly.
