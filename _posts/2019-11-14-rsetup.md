Documenting my installation procedure for R on Arch Linux, so it can be more easily reproduced with less haphazard googling the next time I try this.

# Reasons for installing R

- It's taking a while to get `fastText` on python, for some reason.
- Procastrination?
- Wanted to see what the hype is about

# Tutorials referred to

- [Getting-Started-with-R](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/201141096-Getting-Started-with-R)
- [Packrat Walkthrough](http://rstudio.github.io/packrat/walkthrough.html)
- [Teach Tidyverse to beginners](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/)

# Note

Refer to [Archwiki's entry on R to see the exact specifics on configuration,](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/R#Configuration) but my main takeaway is this:

- If you start `R` anywhere, it takes that directory to be its project directory. I do not like that.
- In all of the commands below, I've created a test-R directory within which I execute all my commands, unless otherwise specified.

# Installation

## R system installation

Decided to use `pacman`, because why not. Is the preferred method.

```
sudo pacman -S r gcc-fortran
```

You can now access the terminal by typing `R` into the terminal.

### IDE

I don't usually use IDEs, but everyone seems to be recommending [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), so we may as well. I believe you can install it from inside R itself, but I used the package available on the [AUR.](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rstudio-desktop-bin/)

```
yay -S rstudio-desktop-bin
```

### Misc

For **installing packages in R**, we [need to install ](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/R#With_R)the `tk` package. 

```
sudo pacman -S tk
```

## Packages in R

You *could* use pacman to install R packages. As a rule, I tend to avoid system level package installations for languages (see: python, JS, etc) when possible, so this goes out of the window. 

Now, the suggested method is to go to the R terminal and `install.packages(package_name)`, but on its own it has the same problem as the method above (for me anyway), just like `pip install` without virtualenvs - and that is the lack of a virtualenv. I'm using [Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) to manage the packages. [This walkthrough](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/walkthrough.html) is great. 

(Inside the R command line interface)
```
install.packages("packrat")
packrat::init()
```

... and that's about it. More details on packrat itself are available at the walkthrough provided.

### Packrat with R-Studio

Since I have RStudio > 0.98, it's inbuilt for me. [Check out this link for more details.](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/rstudio.html)
