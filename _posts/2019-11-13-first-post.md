Hey!

I've experimented previously with multiple blogging platforms, but none of them have particularly worked. On the other hand, I really liked how plaintext/markdown Static Site Generators have felt, when using them to build other websites in the past.

That being said, I haven't really explored all options among these aforesaid bogging platforms. It's clear to me I do not want to host it on [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.com), or for that matter [Medium](http://www.medium.com)[^medium]. I've tried both, and neither work. I could try [Ghost](http://https://ghost.org/) - I guess.

It seems the best option thus would be to self-host something (as far as the definition stretches in this day and age) on something like [Netlify](http://https://www.netlify.com/), or [Github Pages](http://https://pages.github.com/), or even [AWS](http://https://aws.amazon.com/), or any other cloud service provider. "True" self-hosting demands that I set up my own server, eh well who's gonna do that?

So while I currently use Github Pages, [blogs I've read](https://yihui.name/en/2017/06/netlify-instead-of-github-pages/) are convincing me to try out new providers like Netlify; I may even switch to [Hugo](http://https://gohugo.io/). Migration should hopefully *not* be a pain, given the bulk of the content is plaintext. I may need to modify the front matter, if I do - it should not be a concern as such.

[^medium]: My reasons are largely covered in this, wait for it, Medium blog. [https://medium.com/@nikitonsky/medium-is-a-poor-choice-for-blogging-bb0048d19133](https://medium.com/@nikitonsky/medium-is-a-poor-choice-for-blogging-bb0048d19133)
