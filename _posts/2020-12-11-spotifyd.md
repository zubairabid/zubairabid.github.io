title: Setting up Spotifyd with pulseaudio

I can't seem to find any up-to-date setups for this, and have had to endure some
degree of trial and error. Documenting it for myself, and in case others care.

# Basic information

I'm writing this guide for a Linux user who wants to run it with the pulseaudio
backend. A Spotify Premium account is needed for this to work. This does not
cover an installation guide, just how to set it up for pulseaudio.

```bash
â–¶ spotifyd --version
spotifyd 0.2.24
```

# Setting up Spotifyd

## Installing

So the first task is to setup [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd)
on Linux. Installing is easy -- check [their provided guide] to find the
instructions for your specific distribution. I used `pacman -Syu spotifyd` on
mine. From what I understand, the pre-installed binaries for your distribution
might not be compiled to work with pulseaudio, so you will have to either get
the `full` variant, or compile it yourself with the necessary flags. This has
not proven to be a problem on Arch-based systems in my limited testing of one
(1) device.

[their provided guide]: https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd#installation

## Configuration

The base configuration can be copied from [the instructions]. Some changes to
note:

- Your password should not contain '#' or spaces. This is as of late 2020: 
  source in [issue #120]. 
- **Do not use quotes**. The sample configuration file has the general format of 
  `option = "value"`, but you should use `option = value` instead. I *think* the
  space after the '=' is important too.
- The device name cannot have spaces in it.

Overall, this is what the configuration file should look like (stripped of 
comments)

```conf
# The username can be gotten from your Accounts page. It's the convoluted string
# of characters, not the Email ID.
username = USERNAME
# Pick any of the password store methods. Don't use quotes anywhere

backend = pulseaudio
volume_controller = alsa  

# The device name can't have spaces. The device type has only cosmetic changes.
device_name = PICKANAME
device_type = computer

bitrate = 320

# create the directory. I chose not to keep a cache, but you might.
cache_path = /home/USER/.cache/spotifyd
no_audio_cache = true

# Disabling normalisation works better for me
initial_volume = 100
volume_normalisation = false
normalisation_pregain = -10

zeroconf_port = 4444
```

### Why am I disabling volume normalisation?

Whatever volume normalisation `spotifyd` uses internally seems to be, honestly,
quiet trash [^nottype]. Where I normally listen to music at 24% volume, I need
to raise it to around 50% to get anywhere close to the same loudness with
normalisation enabled, and the audio is compressed too.

## Starting spotifyd, and a little bit of Systemd

I have opted to start it as a user service, using `systemctl`. You can choose to
run it with `spotifyd --no-daemon` if you so wish.

I created a file called `spotifyd.service` in 
`.config/systemd/user/default.target.wants`. I'm like, 90% sure you need to put
it in the parent folder, but this seems to work fine for now -- I guess you just
don't get to disable the daemon. The file is sourced from [the github link]. As
of the time of writing this, the contents are:

[the github link]: https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd/blob/master/contrib/spotifyd.service

```service
[Unit]
Description=A spotify playing daemon
Documentation=https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd
Wants=sound.target
After=sound.target
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/spotifyd --no-daemon
Restart=always
RestartSec=12

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Check that your service is running with `systemctl status --user
spotifyd.service`. In fact, for a quick tutorial on systemd daemon services:

```bash
# Starts the service
systemctl start --user spotifyd.service

# Restarts the service
systemctl restart --user spotifyd.service

# Enables the service; it should autostart on boot
systemctl enable --user spotifyd.service

# Disables the service; it should stop autostarting on boot
systemctl disable --user spotifyd.service
# again, I'm not sure this works with my configuration. It wasn't ideal.

# Checks how the service is going
systemctly status --user spotifyd.service
```

At this point, you should have a functional `spotifyd` instance running. If you
check your devices on any client, you should see your device popping up, and can
play audio through this.

# Running a client

At the moment, I'm just using [Spotify TUI], written in Rust. This step is not
necessary if you want to, say, play music from your phone.

Installation instructions are [given here]. For arch-based systems, run `yay -S
spotify-tui` (or use your preferred AUR helper. If you're new to the AUR, check
the [arch wiki]). This will take a while as it compiles. 

Once done, you can launch the client by running `spt` on the terminal.
Configuration is easy enough -- the intial startup gives instructions, and they
are trivial enough to follow.
