# zubairabid.github.io

Static personal webpage for use in general, or for institute webpage(s).

As of right now, it uses Jekyll, HTML5 and pure CSS. I may use it for sass-testing, and will update this README accordingly. 

**If you notice any issues/typos/etc, please don't hesitate to contribute with a pull request!**. Suggestions are welcome.

Thank you.
