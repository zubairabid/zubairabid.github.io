- The general idea springs from the filesystem debate and ideas around general
  purpose computing for the masses.
- The specific idea is about how interfaces when evolving from CLI to GUI (and
  beyond with further abstractions) become easier to use, but also lose
  expressiveness. It is not possible to move around files in newer systems, but
  you can have the system do it for you. But anything that's not programmed in,
  you're at a loss. Similarly, you can do a lot with GUIs, but so many things
  are just easier/just more doable with CLIs. And you could extend it further,
  with the idea that if you script things on your own, interfacing with the
  filesystem that's not strictly under CLI use anymore, you have even more
  available.
- Now with programming that makes sense, you're literally expressing yourself.
  But the shift from CLI to GUI should not become as restrictive as it is in
  theory, as the visual dimension is a massive one that would ideally take on
  the pros of both the CLI and the GUI. Maybe because why would you bother when
  the CLI can just do it better?
