- Mostly a way to track some of my major opinions. As always, all of this is
  prefaced with a heavy dose of preference.
- Background: Got into mechanical keyboards a while back, finally bought one in December.
- On Layouts:
  - Will be getting a Lotus 58 soon
  - Had said 65% preferred, I now disagree. Although I will get a 65% in Feb.
    For now 60s are my favourite layout, having tried Fullsize, 75, 65, 60.
    - Specifically, I like having arrows near the homerow like with my Ducky. I
      have since gotten a GK61 that has arrows at a more "conventional"
      position, and I dislike having to move my hand so much to make it work.
  - Looking forward to 40s, but issues I had with lack of number row:
    - Specifically, was looking at the Corne (when both Lotus and Corne were
      options)
    - Lack of number row meant harder to configure Minecraft things like 
      F3+H/G/Q. Having a number row means it's still easier to configure; I
      won't have to move the number row around.
    - This is only really an issue with the 40% as the "only board". I have
      since built an ai03 Soyuz that can be used as a macropad...
- On keyboard materials:
  - Don't personally get the hype behind metal keyboards, although I haven't
    tried them yet. It's a bit expensive to just "buy and try" -- even the Tofu
    will set me back about 16k. Waiting for meetups to make a judgement. On
    sound tests they seem a bit high pitched, but we know how it is with
    soundtests (link simon's video). Why am I being judgemental without trying
    it (as in, singling this out while I haven't tried others)? Because they're
    very hyped, and *very* expensive.
  - Interested in some 3D-Printed ways, Luberman on discord mentioned a nice
    configuration that I might try for my Lotus once I get a printer and some
    experience, which is a while away.
  - Wooden cases, too. Although manufacturing them to the right tolerances might
    be a pain in the butt.
  - Stacked acrylic seems to high-pitched in sound tests, which is why I didn't
    go for the potato. Again, want a meetup to hear how it sounds.
  - FR4 sandwich -- will be how the Lotus is initially. Currently have my Soyuz
    on it, and don't particularly like how the U4Ts sound on it.
- On switches:
  - Mostly, anything over 62g feels too heavy. Even Boba U4s, which I have 62g,
    feel *just* too heavy. 57g slows are great on most switches I've had. My
    FFFFs are swapped with 57g slows, and they feel amazing.
  - Linears are an interesting proposition. In theory, they're smooth and
    comfortable. My experience has not been the same, with Gateron yellows they
    just felt "empty". Need to try other linears. Had some experience with Sup's
    Pom linears which were nice, but need some more hands on time with them.
  - With Tactiles, I think I lean towards low tactility rather than strong
    tactility -- I want the bump to be brushed past with some effort, making it
    "fun", not an actual finger workout. U4s in that regard are too tactile and
    FFFFs perfect, but both have flaws as I'll say later. I want to try Holy
    Pandas that sup has, he describes them as "ffff but rounder"
  - Clicky -- I don't mind the tactility, but they are too loud. Work with the
    headphone test, but not without, personally.
  - Gateron yellows don't feel too great stock. Spring swapped, and L+F is still
    fine -- but nothing special, any tactile feels better (except maybe Speed
    Coppers and Cherry Browns). There are moments in typing where the _ease_ of
    the linear shines through, but that is rare. Would need to try more linear
    builds to make a judgement. Sup's Pom linears felt nice, but I didn't try
    them out long enough.
  - Opinions on FFFF (TODO) maybe scratchy, feels nice, not perfect.
  - Opinions on U4s (TODO) too tactile, feels nice, not perfect. Maybe FFFF
    tactility and U4s silence.
  - Will do proper switch comparisons later maybe, idk.
- Misc:
  - At least two keyboards sounds like a good idea -- both built differently, so
    you get different kinds of typing experiences. Definitely a recommendation
    to build one each with as many switches as you love + one silent mech 
    (in my case, silent mechs are switches I love).
  - Not sure how I feel about sound on keyboards. I like some sound, but found
    that most switches are just too annoying on the GK/empty on the Ducky. Maybe
    a good keyboard will improve how switches sound, but for now I like how
    silence is? Maybe. Silent switches do feel empty sounding, but part of it
    might be the slightly dampened feel (which is fine on U4s, but I haven't
    tried other silent switches which are renowned to be not as good. Not on a
    full board anyway).
