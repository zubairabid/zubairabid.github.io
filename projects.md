# Projects

I've done a few over the past few years

## Non-coursework and open-source contributions

1. **Pathfinding Visualiser** July 2020 

    Implemented a pathfinding visualiser in Vanilla JavaScript that works on 
    the basis of contour terrain maps, and not simply mazes. The grid is 
    inherently a weighted graph, and path choices can be affected by the cost 
    incurred to time or energy utilisation by "uphill" or "downhill" movements.
    The project included the implementation of the A-star and Djikstra's
    algorithms, along with a custom algorithm for natural contoured terrain 
    generation. [Link](https://zubairabid.github.io/MarsRover/)

2. **Discord Quiz Bot** March 2020 - Present
    
    Worked on [Harish Krishna's bot for conducting discord quizzes](https://github.com/harishkrishnav/PounceScoreBounceBot),
    that is based on an [earlier project by me](https://github.com/zubairabid/QuizPounceBot)
    to implement send-only channels in discord (for pouncing in quizzes).
    Worked on code cleanup, and added slide-sharing as pictures functionality.

3. **The Neovim Project** March 2020 - Present
    
    Contributing bugfixes to [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim).

## Course Projects

1. **Hybrid MT: Implementation of UVR-NMT** April 2020
    
    Implemented the [Neural Machine Translation with Universal Visual Representation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byl8hhNYPS)
    paper in a team of two as part of a NLP Applications course project,
    for EN-FR translation. Also implemented basic Attention for the baseline.

2. **Learning Bilingual word embeddings with minimal bilingual data** November 2019
    
    Implemented [A robust self-learning method for fully unsupervised cross-lingual mappings of word embeddings](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1073)
    in a team of two as part of a NLP course project, for EN-HI data.

1. **Sentiment Classification for Bengali News Articles** May 2019
    
    Creating a pipeline for polarity classification of Bengali news articles 
    using multiple methods, and comparing the results using three different 
    methods of evaluation [Link](https://github.com/zubairabid/CL2-Project)
2. **Acronym Disambiguation by word usage Analysis** November 2018

    Built a system in a team of two to use the context around the occurrence 
    of an acronym and to make an estimation as to the correct expansion 
    intended to a reasonably high degree of accuracy.

3. **High-Low Game in the Ethereum Blockchain** September 2019
    
    Wrote a smart contract and tests, in a team of two, to play the High-Low 
    House vs Players game in Solidity. 
    [Link](https://github.com/zubairabid/HighLowSolidity)
4. **Interactive Linux Shell in C** October 2018

    Wrote a basic interactive Linux shell interpreter in C, supporting all 
    basic commands like ls and cd, and process management procedures.

5. **Proxy Server in Python** April 2019

    Made an HTTP web server in a team of two that caches webpages and 
    implements authentication and blacklisting as part of my Computer Networks 
    Assignment. [link](https://github.com/cathreya/Proxy-Server)
5. **Basic Language Model and Tokenizer** September 2019

    Built an English Language Tokenizer to correctly identify numbers, email 
    addresses, mentions, currency values, and more. Runs 5x faster than 
    NLTK's default word_tokenize.

    Made a basic n-gram language model, applied Kneyser-Ney Smoothing, and 
    evaluated it. [link](https://github.com/zubairabid/Parser_LM/)
5. **Comparison of Image Classification techniques and Dimensionality reduction methods** November 2019

    As part of our Statistical Methods in AI course, analysed different 
    techniques for Image Classification using various datasets. 
    Also compared multiple dimensionality reduction methods (Eigenfaces, 
    Fisherfaces, Resnet) to gauge the most effective.

5. **Analysis of Gendered Pronoun Usage in Corporate Environments** April 2018

    Analysed an extension of the Enron email corpus to note patterns in usage 
    of gender-neutral pronouns across social strata in a corporate environment

6. **Flight Simulator in C++ OpenGL** March 2019
        
    Made an OpenGL 3D flight game as part of Computer Graphics course. 
    [Link](https://github.com/zubairabid/flightsim)
7. **Infinite Runner in C++ OpenGL** February 2019
    
    Made an 2D OpenGL flight game inspired by Jetpack Joyride, as part of 
    Computer Graphics course. [Link](https://github.com/zubairabid/flightsim)
8. **Mario Game in Python** September 2018
    
    Made an implementation of Mario on the terminal without sprites, pygame,
    or any external libraries other than numpy and colorama. 
    [Link](https://github.com/zubairabid/mario-console)
9. **Instagram clone** April 2018

    As part of our ITWS-II course, made an Instagram clone with Flask (Python),
