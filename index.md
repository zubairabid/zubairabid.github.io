# Hey, I'm Zubair

I'm a 4th Year Undergrad pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and an MS in 
Computational Linguistics (MS) student at 
[_IIIT Hyderabad_](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). 
I'm expected (hoping) to graduate in 2022.

My current research topic is in NLP, specifically concerning _Language 
Embeddings_. I have worked a bit on _Knowledge Graphs_ in the past.
I work in the MT-NLP Lab in IIIT Hyderabad, under the guidance of Prof. 
[Manish Shrivastava](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=sIvMnGQAAAAJ&hl=en).

I currently hold the position of my Institute's _Student Web Admin_, since
July 2019, and am responsible for building and deploying websites on 
Institute servers.

Apart from these I'm also involved in a number of clubs. I am currently
a writer for [Ping!](https://pingiiit.org/), the Student Media Body, and was 
the _Editor-in-Chief_ from August 2018 to July 2020. I have been
_Head of Tech_ and _Head of Events_ for the college's 
[Entrepreneurship Cell](https://ecell.iiit.ac.in/). I was also briefly
involved as a designer for the Alumni Cell.
