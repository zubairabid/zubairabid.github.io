# Hey, I'm Zubair

I'm a 4th Year Undergrad pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and an MS in 
Computational Linguistics (MS) student at [_IIIT Hyderabad_](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). 
I'm expected (hoping) to graduate in 2022.

My current research topic is in NLP, specifically concerning _Knowledge Graphs_.
I work in the MT-NLP Lab in IIIT Hyderabad, under the guidance of Prof. 
[Manish Shrivastava](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=sIvMnGQAAAAJ&hl=en).

I currently hold the position of my Institute's _Student Web Admin_, and am 
responsible for building and deploying websites on Institute servers.

Apart from these I'm also involved in a number of clubs. I am currently the
_Editor-in-Chief_ for [Ping!](https://pingiiit.org/), the Student Media Body, 
and have been _Head of Tech_ and _Head of Events_ for the college's 
[Entrepreneurship Cell](https://ecell.iiit.ac.in/). I was also briefly
involved as a designer for the Alumni Cell.
